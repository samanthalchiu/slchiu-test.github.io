# Hi all! If you've somehow stumbled across this github, let me introduce myself! My name's Samantha and I'm a graduate student at the University of Iowa. I study psycholinguistics in the Cognition and Perception program in the Psychological and Brain Sciences Department.

# My research lines span multiple areas, including psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and cognitive neuroscience. But to be more specific... 

# Talker Adaptation via Unsupervised Learning: How do you adapt to a unique talker's speech productions? 
# Effect of Linguistic Environment on Speech Perception: How does one's auditory linguistic environment (i.e. one's social network) influence how they perceive speech? 
# Using EEG and machine learning (supervised classifier) to extract lexical competition in speech perception and assess efficiency in speech processing across time. 

# As for this github, you'll hopefully find folders from these projects with sample code I've written. Please send me any questions if you have any!

# P.S. This summer I'm working on a side project to try and flex some machine learning skills! Stay tuned...
